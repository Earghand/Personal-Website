            <p id="problem">
                Since many college students were forced to return home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many were deprived of social interaction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp; ACM Teammate finder was a web application designed shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic forced many students to leave college campuses and resume learning at home remotely. The purpose of this application is to resume social interaction through online events, including study sessions for similar classes, gaming sessions, watch parties, etc. To build this application, we leveraged Node.js with Express, React with RMWC design elements, Firebase/Firestore for user authentication and real-time database. </p>
        <br>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; &emsp; Since many college students were forced to return home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many were deprived of the in-person experience. I found it difficult to make new friends since the pandemic began during my first-year of college. This resulted in a deterioration of my mental health since I was unable to meet new people.
                <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Since many people make new friends in college, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented many first-year students from meeting peers in their classes or other student organizations. Upon reflecting on my own experience and learning about the experience of others, it was clear that social interaction presented immense significance for the mental health of many students.

            <h2>Need-Finding and Research</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First, we figured that we needed to create an application that could apply to any social organization, study group, or simply anyone trying to find friends.</li>
                <br>
                <li>We figured that with these events, it needs to have specialized features so that the events could be specific and people would know who, what, and where the events are.</li>
                <br>
                <li>To achieve this, we needed to come up with a template for each event, including a name, description, time, location, and image.</li>
                <br>
                <li>We also needed to find a way for users to search for these events. We created some filtered categories the user can choose as well as a search query that would utilize key words in the title of an event to search.</li>
                <br>
                <li>For this, we figured that using the Firestore database would be the most effective and easiest method to achieve these complex database requests.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the first user, we wanted to make sure that the user flow of creating an account, creating and modifying an event. This would be from the perspective of a user creating an event for others to view.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The second user we created was one that was looking for an event. This perspective consisted of searching for an event, utilizing the filters, joining an event, and viewing information about the event accordingly.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Both of these user personas proved to be difficult because we needed to make sure the correct controls were provided to each user and made sure that the host has special permissions and features that those joining do not have.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <img src="assets/teamWireFrame1.png">
        <ul>
            <li>For our low-fidelity wireframes, we created a basic signup and login system for each user along with the ability to create events and other user’s to view it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>We figured that to make this more intuitive, we would add the ability for user’s to view who joins their events.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This part proved to be a bit more difficult since we needed to make sure there was a flow for everything such as redirection from various pages, confirmation popups, restricting access to specific pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
        <img src="assets/teammateColor.png">
        <p>Since this website is catered towards ACM, we figured that using their color scheme from the ACM UCSD Website would be the best option</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Website UI Toolkit</h2>
        <img src="assets/rmwc.png">
        <p>We decided to use Google's RMWC React UI Toolkit to achieve the various designs in our wireframes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>

        <br>
        <h2>Final Product and Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Overall, this project demonstrated significant technical overbearing since creating a website with user-authentication added more security concerns</li>
            <br>
            <li>Some of these concerns included accessing pages a user should be restricted from accessing, causing lag due to too many CRUD functions occurring at the same time, and the learning curve of React.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Since this project was to be done in five weeks and many of the team members never had exposure to React or Firestore, it proved to be a significant challenge.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Firebase/Firestore is makes it easy to setup a robust authentication system and database quickly, though it can be difficult to work with.</li>
